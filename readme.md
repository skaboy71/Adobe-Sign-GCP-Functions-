## Gets Adobe Sign related "form data" from agreement as JSON

Adobe Sign returns "form data" as a csv formatted string.  This is really a problem for use in things like MS flow, zappier, ifttt, nintex and other workflow platforms. 

Soooo since I'm a huge fan of python and open source, I wrote this GCP Function to use the API token(oAuth or integration key), the "shard"(geolocation), the sender's email address, and the API related agreement ID to get the csv data and convert it to JSON.  It then returns this JSON which can be used by most of these workflow platforms.

#### The setup

Open a GCP Account.  Create a new function and set it up something like this:

Copy and paste the code from [my .py file](https://github.com/skaboy71/Adobe-Sign-GCP-Functions-/blob/master/getFormDataCsvAs-JSON.py) over the top of the existing code in the main.py

Set the "Function to execute" to "get_csv_json".

In the requirements.txt paste the below:

```
requests>=2.22.0
pandas>=0.24.2
```

##### Deploy the function

Once it's deployed, you can call it via the function URL using a POST and passing the necessary data to it in the JSON body of your post.

Example:
```JSON
{
	"shard": "na2",
	"token": "3AAABLblqZhD7gPDMJ5vjNsKg*** Your API Token Here ***2WqAsaG1oYtllVLaHv9e",
	"ag_id": "CBJCHBCAAB*** Your V5 or V6 agreement ID here ***hgcVEyj-oI",
	"s_email": "senders-email@yourdomain.com"
}
```
